1. We have first made some changes on the app component, the component can contain HTML layout
and CSS styling which make it possible for that to be shown on the web app. 
-A component can contain other components as well, think of them as DIV.
-They are the building blocks of Angular so keep them in mind

  IMPORTANT: Each component has its own metadata (properties)

2. We then added a home component, which included different HTML and CSS
-This component was put inside the App Component, ->  imports: [HomeComponent] <-
-We also gave it styling as well

3. We have created a housingLocation component which we'll use later
-We have given it the necessary properties and also imported it into the HouseComponent

4. We have created an Interface called Housinglocation which we will use later on
-It includes necessary details regarding a showing of a house, such as address name and others

5. We've added property bindings, so homeComponent can know to show data from housinglocation
-This is done on through the [attribute] = "value" syntax, which tells Angular that
the assigned value should be treated as a property
-Ive made these changes on the template, inside the <app-housing-location></...> section

6. Ive made changes on housing-location-component and ive added sth called interpolation
-Using property binding ive made changes on the Template, HTML markup, to be able to show a photo of the house

7. You learned to use the ngFor function which is basically a foor loop
-You made the HousingLocation a list and gave it multiple instances of a house
-You managed to show all the houses, they now appear on the webpage as listings together with a few details. 
-You worked with -> export class HomeComponent <-
